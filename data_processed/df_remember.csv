participant8,traffic,"The road here was previously a busy junction, with cars moving quickly in all directions. This has been altered to include a dedicated cycle lane in both directions, as well as a speed limit reduction to 30km/h. This has improved traffic safety and reduced noise pollution.",Adding cycle lanes and cutting speed limits.
participant8,greenery,"The roadside here was previously used for parking, with cars, such as the grey sedan, being left here for long periods. The side of the road parking has been replaced with flowerbeds and cycle racks to promote more cycling around the city.",Reducing dormant parking.
participant8,canopy,"The open area of road here was previously a major reflector of heat, creating an urban oven. The plan is to reduce the asphalt coverage by planting over 150 trees and adding more vegetation to reduce road temperatures by around 8 degrees.",Reducing road temperature
participant8,biodiversity,"This highlights the diversity in the proposed flora changes - with a mixture of ground cover, shrubs and trees to increase biodiversity, including providing a habitat for native butterflies.",Using varied flora types to increase biodiversity
participant8,sponge,"Here, asphalt has been removed and replaced with an alternative paving that allows water from the fountain to be stored more efficiently.",Water conservation

participant9,residents,500 residents involved in the project and 30 businesses. There was also 22 of something else. ,Outline of the project.
participant9,traffic,The cars used to be very noisy and all you could hear. Now you can hear the tingling of bells and the whoosh of the bicycles as cars reduced to speed limit of 30kph. ,Noise levels
participant9,greenery,70% of the urban roads were taken up with parking space. This sedan has been idle for 3 days and not benefitting the community. Now shrubs have been planted where there were parking spaces and racks to lock bikes away have been created.,Parking
participant9,canopy,The heat of the asphalt meant temperatures rose by 8 degrees. ,Temperature
participant9,biodiversity,"The planting of 3 different layers - the grass and flowers, the shrubs and finally the trees support  biodiversity where they can operate on different levels. This also benefits things like butterflies which can be seen flying around.",Biodiversity
participant9,sponge,The solid asphalt means nowhere for the rain to go but now these sponge like bricks have been put in that will absorb the rain in levels 30 centimetres below the surface. This also means nutrients in the water are not lost.,Flooding
participant3,residents,The video showed people sitting outside. It said that the views of 500 residents and 35 local businesses had been collected via surveys. 40 community members had joined a design workshop. All the information collected from the community was gathered into a recommendation notebook.,consultation
participant3,traffic,"The video talked about the main avenue of the town, which was dominated by cars before the transformation. Afterwards, there was a 30 kph speed limit for cars, and a new bicycle lane to encourage cycling. More than 120 km of bicycle lanes were installed in the town.",changing transport
participant3,greenery,"The third video described how almost 70% of the public space was taken up by parking. The redesign will reduce the space for vehicle parking, and it will be replaced by bike racks and greenery.",public_space
participant3,canopy,"This video talked about the effect of large areas of asphalt which absorb and re-radiate heat in the summer, making the town unpleasantly hot. The re-design involves planting new trees which will provide shade and reduce the ground temperature by up to 8 C.",tree planting
participant3,biodiversity,This video talks about using a layered system of planting to support biodiversity at different heights above the ground.,biodiversity
participant3,sponge,"The last video talked about how large areas of asphalt absorb heat, and also contributed to flooding during heavy rain. The new redesigned road will have permeable tiles that allow water to flow into a special layer of gravel and soil to reduce the strain on drains during heavy rain.",flood prevention
participant10,residents,"The changes of the city were possible thanks to both the residents and the business owners.
There was a document, I don't recall its name though, used for common decisions.",residents
participant10,traffic,"Before the transformation, there was a lot of traffic jam, many cars making noise and being absolute protagonists of the main avenue.
After the transoformation, less cars than before drive through the main avenue, now instead there are many bicycle. Also, the speed limits have been introduced.",traffic
participant10,greenery,"Before the change there were many veichles parked next to the sidewalk.
Green spaces have been created in areas that were previously used for car parking.",parking

participant10,biodiversity,"Flowerbeds have been introduced, and as a result, native species have returned to the area (I can't remember the name of the butterfly, I think it was mentioned in latin)",flower
participant10,sponge,"A system has been installed beneath the asphalt to reduce flooding caused by rain. If I’m not mistaken, it involves plants that can be seen through the manholes. I don’t remember how much water it’s able to absorb.",rain
