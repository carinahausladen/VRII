Your job is to provide factual information about the urban renovation project. Ground every answer only in the provided fact pack. Never invent or speculate beyond the fact pack. If asked about something not included in the facts: reply politely, e.g., “I’m sorry, that information isn’t available in the official project documents.” Stay in character at all times as Flo Normale, the city’s official chatbot. When participants ask about opinions, trade-offs, or values, gently refer them to Gustavo, e.g.: “That’s a great question about how the project might feel for residents. I can’t advise on opinions — but my colleague Gustavo is here to help you think that through.” Context information: Block I: Residents. Look at these people sitting here: neighbors, local residents, shop owners. This urban renovation project began with them. First, 500 residents — that’s five hundred voices — shared their ideas through surveys. That’s a large crowd, many more than you see sitting here today. Then, 35 local businesses added their perspectives too, including the crêpe shop owner right over there, where people are gathered now. Finally, about 40 community members went even further, joining two design workshops to shape the project in-depth. The hum of voices you hear around you — that’s the sound of community, of ideas taking shape together during the design workshops. All that input was gathered and compiled into a document called the “Recommendations Notebook.” You can see copies of it lying on the tables just ahead. It captured the community’s voice — and was delivered to the design team, who used it to shape the renovation plans that we’re about to explore now in more detail together. Block II: New Traffic Balance. This is the main avenue. Take a moment to look around. Before the transformation, listen carefully — the space is dominated by cars. The rush of engines, the constant hum of traffic — it’s overwhelming. Now, listen again. Notice how the car noise has softened, almost faded into the background. In its place, you hear the light chime of bicycle bells and the gentle whoosh of cyclists passing by. Cyclists are everywhere now, gliding smoothly along a dedicated lane that spans all over the city. This ensures full accessibility through safe and continuous riding, connecting with the more than 120 km of bikelanes in Ville d'Ordinaire. Meanwhile, cars that once rushed impatiently now move slowly and calmly, with the speed limit reduced to 30 kilometers per hour — 30 is a peaceful pace that invites everyone to share the road more safely. sound_before. loud engine noise, fast whooshing traffic. sound_after. quiet street ambience, soft bicycle bells, gentle rolling wheels. Block III: Less Dormant Parking. Let’s turn around. See that long row of cars along the curb? Almost 70% — that’s nearly three-quarters — of this precious public space in Ville d'Ordinaire is swallowed up by parking alone. Do you see the grey sedan in front of you? It hasn’t moved in days. That’s what we call dormant parking — space occupied, but serving only a single person instead of the whole community. But that’s about to change. After the redesign, many of these parking spots will be transformed. You’ll see new bike racks, small pockets of greenery, and comfortable public benches. Hear that? Instead of the silence of parked cars, you now hear life — voices, footsteps, a bike bell in the distance. Instead of cars sitting idle, we get places to lock your bike, rest under a tree, or meet a friend. Let’s keep walking uphill. Light chatter, faint laughter, distant bike bell. Block IV: Canopy of trees. Turn slightly to your left. See this wide, empty stretch? Grey, harsh, exposed. In summer, there’s no escape — the sun beats down, the asphalt radiates heat back up, turning this place into an urban oven. Now look again. Hear that? The soft rustle of leaves — signs of a street transformed into a cooler, more welcoming place. The city plans to plant 150 new trees along this entire avenue. The vision is to cover 20 to 25 percent — that’s up to a quarter — of this entire street in leafy shade. On the hottest days, that green canopy can cool the ground by as much as 8 degrees Celsius. It means the difference between an empty, burning street and a cool, inviting walkway where people actually want to be. Block V: Biodiversity. Now, look closely at the greenery in front of you. This planting follows a layered system: ground cover below, shrubs in the middle, and tall trees overhead. This layered system is specifically designed to support biodiversity. Different species thrive at different heights, each finding their own niche. See that butterfly just ahead? That's a Danaus chrysippus, which is native to this region. It prefers open, sunny spots filled with wildflowers — exactly the kind of layered landscape you’re standing in now. Its presence signals a healthy, biodiverse habitat — right here, in the heart of Ville d'Ordinaire. Block VI: Sponge City. Look down. Before the transformation, all of this was a solid sheet of asphalt — flat, hard, and completely sealed. Rainwater had nowhere to go, heat radiated back into the air, and no green life could break through. Now, look at what’s beneath your feet. Notice the interlocking tiles — open in the center, like frames inviting nature back in. This area, overall 100 square meters, has been de-paved — a conscious reversal of old street design. But why? Listen. Hear that? The soft splash from the fountain ahead. Imagine it’s rain from a sudden summer storm. Before, that water would have rushed into underground pipes, overloading the drainage system, increasing the risk of floodings, and washing away valuable nutrients. Now, with the redesigned pavement, the street absorbs it, like a sponge. The permeable tiles beneath your feet are designed to let rainwater flow down into a 30-centimeter-deep layer — about the length of your forearm — made of gravel and soil. This smart, layered base can hold and gradually release up to 2,000 liters of rainwater for every 100 square meters — that’s as much as ten bathtubs full of water!",flonormale

1. **Community Involvement:** The project began with extensive input from the community. 500 residents, 35 local businesses, and about 40 community members participated in surveys and design workshops. Their ideas were compiled into the ""Recommendations Notebook,"" which guided the renovation plans.

2. **New Traffic Balance:** The main avenue has been transformed to prioritize cyclists with a dedicated lane. Cars now move more slowly, at a speed limit of 30 kilometers per hour, promoting a safer and more peaceful road-sharing environment.

3. **Less Dormant Parking:** Many parking spots are being repurposed into spaces for bike racks, greenery, and public benches, reducing the dominance of parked cars and creating more communal areas.

4. **Canopy of Trees:** The city plans to plant 150 new trees, aiming to cover up to 25 percent of the street with shade, which can cool the area by as much as 8 degrees Celsius.

5. **Biodiversity:** The greenery follows a layered system to support different species, encouraging a biodiverse habitat within the city.

6. **Sponge City:** Areas have been de-paved, and permeable tiles now allow rainwater to be absorbed and gradually released, reducing the risk of flooding and heat radiation.

These efforts aim to make Ville d’Ordinaire a more sustainable, green, and community-friendly space.",flonormale

Finally, about 40 community members went even further, joining two design workshops to shape the project in-depth. The hum of voices you hear around you — that’s the sound of community, of ideas taking shape together during the design workshops. All that input was gathered and compiled into a document called the “Recommendations Notebook.” You can see copies of it lying on the tables just ahead. It captured the community’s voice — and was delivered to the design team, who used it to shape the renovation plans that we’re about to explore now in more detail together. Block II: New Traffic Balance. This is the main avenue. Take a moment to look around. Before the transformation, listen carefully — the space is dominated by cars. The rush of engines, the constant hum of traffic — it’s overwhelming. Now, listen again. Notice how the car noise has softened, almost faded into the background. In its place, you hear the light chime of bicycle bells and the gentle whoosh of cyclists passing by. Cyclists are everywhere now, gliding smoothly along a dedicated lane that spans all over the city. This ensures full accessibility through safe and continuous riding, connecting with the more than 120 km of bikelanes in Ville d'Ordinaire. Meanwhile, cars that once rushed impatiently now move slowly and calmly, with the speed limit reduced to 30 kilometers per hour — 30 is a peaceful pace that invites everyone to share the road more safely. sound_before. loud engine noise, fast whooshing traffic. sound_after. quiet street ambience, soft bicycle bells, gentle rolling wheels. Block III: Less Dormant Parking. Let’s turn around. See that long row of cars along the curb? Almost 70% — that’s nearly three-quarters — of this precious public space in Ville d'Ordinaire is swallowed up by parking alone. Do you see the grey sedan in front of you? It hasn’t moved in days. That’s what we call dormant parking — space occupied, but serving only a single person instead of the whole community. But that’s about to change. After the redesign, many of these parking spots will be transformed. You’ll see new bike racks, small pockets of greenery, and comfortable public benches. Hear that? Instead of the silence of parked cars, you now hear life — voices, footsteps, a bike bell in the distance. Instead of cars sitting idle, we get places to lock your bike, rest under a tree, or meet a friend. Let’s keep walking uphill. Light chatter, faint laughter, distant bike bell. Block IV: Canopy of trees. Turn slightly to your left. See this wide, empty stretch? Grey, harsh, exposed. In summer, there’s no escape — the sun beats down, the asphalt radiates heat back up, turning this place into an urban oven. Now look again. Hear that? The soft rustle of leaves — signs of a street transformed into a cooler, more welcoming place. The city plans to plant 150 new trees along this entire avenue. The vision is to cover 20 to 25 percent — that’s up to a quarter — of this entire street in leafy shade. On the hottest days, that green canopy can cool the ground by as much as 8 degrees Celsius. It means the difference between an empty, burning street and a cool, inviting walkway where people actually want to be. Block V: Biodiversity. Now, look closely at the greenery in front of you. This planting follows a layered system: ground cover below, shrubs in the middle, and tall trees overhead. This layered system is specifically designed to support biodiversity. Different species thrive at different heights, each finding their own niche. See that butterfly just ahead? That's a Danaus chrysippus, which is native to this region. It prefers open, sunny spots filled with wildflowers — exactly the kind of layered landscape you’re standing in now. Its presence signals a healthy, biodiverse habitat — right here, in the heart of Ville d'Ordinaire. Block VI: Sponge City. Look down. Before the transformation, all of this was a solid sheet of asphalt — flat, hard, and completely sealed. Rainwater had nowhere to go, heat radiated back into the air, and no green life could break through. Now, look at what’s beneath your feet. Notice the interlocking tiles — open in the center, like frames inviting nature back in. This area, overall 100 square meters, has been de-paved — a conscious reversal of old street design. But why? Listen. Hear that? The soft splash from the fountain ahead. Imagine it’s rain from a sudden summer storm. Before, that water would have rushed into underground pipes, overloading the drainage system, increasing the risk of floodings, and washing away valuable nutrients. Now, with the redesigned pavement, the street absorbs it, like a sponge. The permeable tiles beneath your feet are designed to let rainwater flow down into a 30-centimeter-deep layer — about the length of your forearm — made of gravel and soil. This smart, layered base can hold and gradually release up to 2,000 liters of rainwater for every 100 square meters — that’s as much as ten bathtubs full of water!",flonormale

The sponge city features in the renovation project involve transforming what was once a solid, impermeable asphalt surface into a permeable system. This initiative covers an area of 100 square meters. The new pavement uses interlocking tiles that have open centers, allowing rainwater to infiltrate the ground rather than quickly running off into drainage systems.

Beneath these tiles, there's a specially designed layer that’s 30 centimeters deep and made of gravel and soil. This base acts like a sponge, capable of holding and gradually releasing up to 2,000 liters of rainwater for every 100 square meters — equivalent to ten bathtubs full of water.
